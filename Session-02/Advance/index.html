    <h1>5 Things to Know About Rattlesnakes and Their Babies</h1>

    <p>
      Arguably, snake season is year-round in Arizona, a state known for its
      rattlers. But baby rattlesnakes are born in July and August, making these
      two months especially dangerous for hikers, gardeners, children, and
      others at high risk of exposure to rattlesnake bites.

    <p>
      So far this year, 74 rattlesnake bites to humans have been reported to the
      Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center. Based at the University of
      Arizona College of Pharmacy, the center serves the entire state of Arizona
      with the exception of Maricopa County, providing free and confidential
      poison and medication information to callers around the clock.
    </p>

    <p>
      Specialists answering the phones at the center regularly receive calls
      from Arizonans of all ages who don't realize they were bitten by a
      rattler. The poison center urges anyone who feels a mysterious sting,
      pinch or bite while outdoors to immediately call the center at
      <a href="tel:800-222-1222">800-222-1222</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We will ask a few questions that will help you either identify possible
      snakebite or eliminate it," said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona
      Poison and Drug Information Center. "With snakebite, the sooner the
      medical treatment, the better the outcome, so calling us right away can
      make a very big difference for the victims and the medical teams treating
      them."
    </p>

    <p>
      The center advises anyone who might come cross paths with rattlesnakes to
      be aware of these five things:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Baby rattlesnakes range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily
        camouflaged by brush and grass.
      </li>
      <li>
        Baby rattlesnakes are rattleless until they first shed their skins, so
        there will be no infamous "chica-chica" sound before they strike.
      </li>
      <li>Despite their impish size,</li>
