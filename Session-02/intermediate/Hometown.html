      <h2>Things to do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Soak in the Grandiose of Rumi Darwaza</h3>
          - The famed archways of Rumi Darwaza stand tall and in all its
          grandeur to this day; despite the extra fittings of iron and steel to
          support its magnificent structure. Built in the year 1784, it is one
          of the most impressive historical places in Lucknow. Akin to the grand
          entrance gates of Constantinople (present day Istanbul), the Darwaza
          is an exemplary portrayal of Awadhi architecture, complete with its
          flowers and other intricate detailing. The entire structure is 60 feet
          tall and has a tower space where once lanterns used to light up at
          night to illuminate the pathway below. While you can always visit it
          during the day, visiting it at night is one of the must-do things in
          Lucknow. On full moon days, the sight is even surreal. P.S: Were you
          also thinking the name had to do something with the famous Persian
          poet – Rumi? Well, the name of the gate has nothing to do with him but
          with the fact that the word ‘Rumi’ is related to Rome. Muslims used
          this term to refer to the city of Istanbul back in the days when it
          was Byzantium – capital of Eastern Rome. Fascinating, huh!

          <h3>Get lost in the magnificent Bara Imambara</h3>
          - Remnants of colonisation can be seen in almost every part of the
          country. From the names of many streets to structures and terminals,
          but Bara Imambara is one iconic monument which is a true example of
          Mughal and Awadh architecture, devoid of any influence from the
          European elements of buildings. You can enter this humongous complex
          through two gates, both merging to the same colossal courtyard in the
          middle. Spend an entire day exploring its large courtyards, impressive
          gateways, intriguing step wells or simply bow down to Allah at the
          mosque. The central hall of the Imambara is one of the largest (15
          meters in height) in the world. One of the hallways from this
          courtyard leads you to the famous labyrinth – Bhool Bhulaiya. Do keep
          your flashlights if you march ahead and wish to explore the alleys and
          489 similar-looking doors. If you are fortunate enough to find your
          way out of this maze (and to the top), you will be blessed with a
          stunning panoramic view of the entire city! It is also believed that
          the entire complex had hidden tunnels and pathways with treasure
          trunks. Now you know what to keep an eye out for. Apart from these
          marvels of it, there are several other elements of this Imambara which
          make it a must visit place in Lucknow.

          - And now to the most important section of the entire blog – famous
          dishes in Lucknow that you have to try! You know, it won’t be worth
          all the shopping and other fun activities you do in Lucknow, if you
          cannot boast about gorging on tunday, galawati or galoti and kakori
          kebabs. In fact, people might refuse to believe that you went to
          Lucknow, if you tell them you did not try these dishes. Of course, you

          an exclusive food trail across the city. Every piece will literally
          melt-in-your-mouth because it has a labour of love. Minced meats make
          up for the soft filling while the exterior crust is mostly crispy. You

          version of the popular naan and is a Kashmiri dish. Hazratganj,
